					<strong>One of the vexing problems</strong> facing investigators conducting clinical trials is unknowingly including persons who should be excluded due to contemporaneous or previous participation in clinical trials. This could compromise the study results and the health of the patient. <br />
					<br />
					<strong>Sometimes this occurs</strong> as patients do not recall that they had participated in a previous trial, while other times persons may omit this information to obtain the benefit afforded to them by entering a clinical trial such as treatment or some other benefit or compensation. In the absence of privacy concerns, a global registry of patients in clinical trials could be kept and patients enrolment in a new study cross-checked with this registry. Such an endeavor, however, would violate medical confidentiality.<br />
